# KyraBoyle-405
I started with doing multiple codes to see what worked and to see what reached the best end result after deciding on my current code, getting to the current code was a lot of trial and error, there was multiple different code and multiple different things that happened some was interactive and some was still, I chose to link all three artists into the work, the use of lines and random colour is obvious but the random positioning with every change is what makes it a little different, the fact the lines layer all so makes the image have some of Mondrian Architecture in it because zooming in on certain parts would create a new image with the lines. 
Getting the code right and finding all the correct ways to do things for this project was the most difficult, feeling like your own knowledge of the code was holding you back was hard and you had to be persistent in research and active in discussing what I thought was needed. If I could improve this piece I would of liked to make it more interactive for the user, I can see the beauty in the work I have produced but I feel if the user could play with it, it would be better received from a wider audience.
This peice is not interactive, you simple watch what happens and watch the image build itself, you can refresh the page to get a diffrent image every time.
